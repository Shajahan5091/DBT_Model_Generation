MODEL NAME: fact_order_item
TARGET TABLE: BSL_MA.DWH_MA.FACT_ORDER_ITEM
SOURCE TABLES: BSL_RAW.DWH_RAW.ORDER_ITEMS
DESCRIPTION: This model transforms raw order item data into a fact table with proper data types, lookups, and calculated fields including extended amounts, discount allocations, and net amounts.
PREREQUISITES: fact_order and dim_product tables must exist for lookup operations
PARAMETER: None
