TARGET TABLE: bsl_ma.dwh_ma.fact_shipment
SOURCE TABLES: bsl_raw.dwh_raw.shipments, bsl_raw.dwh_raw.orders
DESCRIPTION: This model creates a fact table for shipments by combining shipment data with order information to calculate shipping metrics and standardize carrier information.
PREREQUISITES: Source tables bsl_raw.dwh_raw.shipments and bsl_raw.dwh_raw.orders must be available with valid data.
PARAMETER: Incremental model based on shipment_date
